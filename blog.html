            So far I have been doing ok in all of my classes. I've been barely passing my classes and struggling a bit on my assignments. Lately I have been late on work that I haven't turn in. I so badly want to graduate but end up getting lazy most of the time. At the end of the day, I'll start to straiten up and graduate in the end if I just lock in on my work. My school life has also been decent in having fun at school.
